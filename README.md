# Pursuit AI Cohort - Week 1 Review

This is an interactive web-based lesson plan designed to review the foundational concepts of AI-assisted development covered in Week 1.

## Features

- **Interactive Slides:** Lessons are presented in a clean, step-by-step slide format.
- **Clickable Activities:** Each slide contains interactive activities that open in a modal window with detailed explanations and code examples.
- **AI Assistant:** A built-in AI chatbot is available to answer student questions about the material.
- **Modern Design:** The application features a dark, professional theme with frosted glass panels and high-quality background images relevant to each lesson.

## Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the web application.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for all custom styling and layout.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles all the application logic, including slide navigation, modal interactions, and the AI chatbot functionality.

## How to Deploy

You can easily deploy this application for free using GitHub Pages.

1.  **Create a GitHub Repository:** If you haven't already, create a new public repository on GitHub. Name it whatever you like (e.g., `pursuit-ai-week1-review`).
2.  **Upload the Files:** Add the `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` files to your new repository.
3.  **Enable GitHub Pages:**
    - In your repository, go to the **Settings** tab.
    - In the left sidebar, click on **Pages**.
    - Under the "Branch" section, select the branch your code is on (usually `main` or `master`).
    - Leave the folder as `/ (root)`.
    - Click **Save**.
4.  **Access Your Site:** GitHub will take a minute or two to build and deploy your site. Once it's ready, you will see a green bar with the URL of your live site at the top of the Pages settings. It will look something like this:
    `https://your-username.github.io/your-repository-name/`

That's it! Your interactive lesson plan is now live and accessible to anyone with the link.
